# Active Tasks

This file tracks current and background tasks. Update it as you start new work or complete tasks.

## Current Focus

<!-- Example:
**[task-name](tasks/active/task-name.md)** - Priority 1
Brief description of the task
-->

## Background Tasks

<!-- Add tasks you're working on but not currently focused on -->
<!-- Example:
- **[other-task](tasks/active/other-task.md)** - Background work description
-->

## Quick Start New Task

1. Create a new file: `tasks/active/task-name.md`
2. Copy the template from `tasks/active/example-task.md`
3. Add it to this list
4. Tell AI: "I'm working on task-name"

## Moving to Completed

When a task is done:
```bash
mv tasks/active/task-name.md tasks/completed/
```

Then remove it from this list.
