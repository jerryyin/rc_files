# Workspace Context Guidelines

## Meta-Workspace Concept

This is a meta-workspace pattern for AI-assisted development. Rather than making the project directory itself the AI workspace, a separate meta-repository serves as a "control center" that:

- Provides centralized context and documentation for AI assistants
- Maps out where all the various directories live
- Contains workflows, notes, and helper scripts
- Stays version-controlled without polluting the actual project repositories

## Working Environment

**Important:** Maintain a `directory-map.md` for all directory locations.

Actual source and build directories may be scattered across the filesystem and should be referenced by absolute paths.

## Usage Pattern

```bash
cd /path/to/meta-workspace
# Launch AI assistant here
# AI can read/edit files anywhere via absolute paths
```

## Communication Guidelines

When working with AI:

### Do
- Provide task-specific instructions for configuration and incremental builds
- Give explicit authorization before pushing or amending commits
- Make decisions when there's genuine disagreement
- Be direct about what you want

### Don't Expect
- AI to claim work is "production ready" without justification
- Sycophantic responses - light debate on technical matters is encouraged
- AI to initiate long build time activities without confirmation

## Design Documentation

When writing design docs, always include an "Alternatives Considered" section:
- List major, rejected options
- Don't include nit-picky differences
- Focus on major architectural alternatives

## Common Tasks

### Building
- Builds typically happen in separate build trees (see directory-map.md)
- Out-of-tree builds are standard practice
- Multiple build configurations often maintained simultaneously

### Source Navigation
- Source code may be across multiple repositories and worktrees
- Git submodules may be used extensively
- When editing build configs, check both source tree and build tree caches

### Testing
- Run relevant tests after changes
- Use specific test patterns rather than running all tests

## Git Conventions

### Branch Naming
Use the pattern: `users/<username>/<short-description>`

### Submodules
- Git submodules may be used extensively
- When editing build configs, check both source tree and build tree caches

### Important Rules
- Never do `git push` without explicit authorization
- Do not amend commits without explicit authorization
- Stage changes and ask for reviews before committing
- GitHub issue references should use short form #NNNN instead of full URLs
