# No Cursor Signature in Commits

When creating git commits, NEVER include any Cursor-related trailers or signatures such as:
- `Made-with: Cursor`
- `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>`
- Any other auto-appended Cursor attribution

If Cursor automatically appends these trailers to a commit, immediately amend the commit to strip them before proceeding.
