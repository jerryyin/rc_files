# Strict Commit Message Integrity

The commit message that lands in git history MUST be exactly what was composed — no extra lines, trailers, signatures, or metadata appended by any tool, IDE, or automation.

## Rules

1. **No auto-appended content.** Strip any trailers or lines that were not part of the planned message, including but not limited to:
   - `Made-with: ...`
   - `Co-authored-by: ...`
   - `Signed-off-by: ...` (unless the user explicitly requested it)
   - Any other key-value trailer or footer injected by tooling

2. **Verify after every commit.** Run `git log -1 --format="%B"` immediately after committing. If the message contains anything beyond what was intended, amend the commit to remove the extra content before proceeding (e.g. `GIT_EDITOR="sed -i '/^Made-with:/d'" git commit --amend --no-verify`).

3. **Do not add your own extras.** Never insert attribution, explanatory footers, or sign-off lines unless the user asks for them.
